# SoftwareTestAutomations
JUnit5 Tests that verify the class files meet the system requirements

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by designing the system in such a way. System design is based on the purpose of the system and is determined from requirements gathering. Interpreting user needs can be accomplished by eliciting requirements, defining those requirements in an easily understood way for later translation into technical terms and requirements, and then designing the system based on those needs. Once the system is designed, the design should be tested using static analysis to discover any issues before code is actually written. Once corrected, the system design should be refined before moving onto writing code. Software design starts with understanding the purpose of the software and determining requirements of the system based on the user's need. System design can be accomplished in many ways. I prefer the object-oriented programming approach because of the benefits it offers such as encapsulation, portability, abstraction, and polymorphism. Using this approach can add flexibility to the system under design where implementing test automations is well-suited at the unit level.
